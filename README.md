# Notes

This repository contains notes I took when reading IT-related articles.

It is primarly intended for my own usage.

This includes notably:

  - _[ Design patterns ](Design_patterns)_: [Fluent Interface](Design_patterns/fluent.interface.txt)
  - _[ Security ](Security)_: [Content Security Policy](Security/content.security.policy.txt)
  - _[ Javascript_Building_blocks ](JS_Building_Blocks)_: [Event Delegation](Javascript_Building_blocks/event.delegation.txt)
